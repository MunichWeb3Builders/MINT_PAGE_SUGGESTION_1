# W3B OG Token Mint Page Suggestion


## Installation 🛠️

If you are cloning the project then run this first, otherwise you can download the source code on the release page and skip this step.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/HashLips/hashlips_nft_minting_dapp.git
```

Make sure you have node.js installed so you can use npm, then run:

```sh
npm install
```

## Run 

```sh
npm run start
```

Or create the build if you are ready to deploy.

```sh
npm run build
```
